#*# Tabulist type:
	Entire solution (list of lists)
## Neighbourhood:
	Random non-tabu customer. Random operator.  Choose best feasible move out of all combinations in operator.
## Objective function:
	distance x vehicles
## Parameters after tuning:
	Tabu list length -> k = 75
	# 1 iteration = Instances * runtime * samplesize = 4 x 3 x 30 = 360 seconds (6 min) x 20 iterations = 7200 seconds (2 hours)

#*# - Indicates change from "Baseline"
